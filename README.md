## Demo for Android Viper - MVVM Architecture

### Purpose

It demonstrates the way you can combine Dagger 2, RxJava, Retrofit and the Data Binding
Library all together inside the Viper - MVVM Architecture. I inspired from the
already existing __Coursera__ project presented by _Richa Khandelwal_ and added the things
that were missing to cover my needs.

Basically I used:


1. __Dagger 2__ for dependency injection
2. __Retrofit__ to provide Observables from REST endpoints
3. __RxJava__ to provide the ViewModels from my presenters
4. __Data Binding Library__ to provide bind the ViewModels to my layouts

I also tried to cover some part of code with Unit Test and to demonstrate the way
you can actually use Dagger 2 to provide your Mocks.

### Bottom Line

I would really appreciate feedbacks or pull requests and I would also like to exchange ideas on this matter.

Like most of you, I am al also struggling to find the best architecture to use 
in my projects and so far what I could came up with is this.

Thank you for your contribution !!!
